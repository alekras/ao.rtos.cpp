# ao.rtos.cpp
AO-RTOS is a pure object-oriented small footprint real-time operating system for embedded devices. The project is using Active Object (or Actor) concurrency model and finite state machine (FSM) design template as implementation base.

Read more about the project principles in [Active Object real-time OS Web Site](http://krasnopolski.org/alpha/aortos.htm?ajax=github).

Porting to ARM processor (Raspbery Pi ver. 2) is implemented now.
